# Spider Linux

Spider Linux is a work-in-progress, modern, independent, free and open-source
GNU/Linux distribution.

**As of Feb 2022**: The system is in, by no means, a usable state even for an
advanced user. I am working on changing that and so can you :^)

## Philosophy/Motivations

Spider Linux is developed with the following goals in mind: simplicity,
efficiency and functionality. The goal is to have a minimal base system unto
which the user can turn into whatever they desire using a powerful yet simple
package manager/management system. I started the project because I wanted the
best of both worlds when it came to package management, pre-compiled
binary/source-based, but in a more convenient manner.

I had used many distributions before now and I came to the realisation that
they all have 1 flaw (probably purposefully done) which is that they're either
a pre-compiled binary-based distribution or a source-based distribution. Sure
they have ways to install packages of the other paradigm if binaries, or what
have you, don't exist but there isn't a native 1:1 solution or a middle ground.

Let me ask you this, what if you had a server that needed a package urgently,
but there was only a source version of it available? And what if that
source-based package was out-of-date while there was an upstream version
available? And what if you wanted to edit the build file but it was a confusing
and tedious process? This is just one of many processes that Spider Linux aims
to make a lot better.
